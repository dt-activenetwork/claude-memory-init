# Claude Memory System - Exclusion Configuration
# This file defines which files from the mem/ template should be handled during initialization
#
# Two modes:
#   [exclude_on_copy] - Files that are NEVER copied (skipped entirely)
#   [delete_after_init] - Files that are copied, used, then deleted
#
# Each mode supports:
#   [patterns] - Glob patterns (supports * and ?)
#   [files] - Exact file names
#   [directories] - Directory names
#
# Lines starting with # are comments

# exclude_on_copy: Files that are never copied to user projects
# delete_after_init: Files that are copied, used, then deleted (e.g., templates)
